    <h2>Vector Illustration</h2>

    <br><br><br>

    <p>For this topic, we were required to create a vector art piece of a door or balcony.
        <br>
        The dimensions of the final product had to be sized A4 and it was to be created using Adobe Illustrator.
        <br>
        The task consisted of:
    </p>

    <br>

    <ul>
        <li>Explroing the island's colourful doors and balconies through visual research and documenting this through photography</li>
        <li>Choosing a facade out of the images we took in order to recreate it as a vector illustration</li>
        <li>Sketching and planing in order to have a clear idea of how we are going to translate the image into vector shapes</li>
        <li>And lastly, creating the illustration in Illustrator</li>
    </ul>
